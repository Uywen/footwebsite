    <h2>What is Football ?</h2>
    <p>Football is a sport played in every continent on the planet and is often know an as the best sport in the world.
        Football is more than just kicking a ball around and hoping that it gets into the back of the net. Football is a
        form of art that nobody can really describe.Its an Art that can be mastered and through hard word and dedication
        you can
        become the best at it, but it takes alot of work. The names of the 3 people above are players that have mastered
        this Art
        and became successful professional players and are known as the "GOAT"(Greatest of all time)<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75xsabPPJfc">See why they are called the Goats of
            football</a>.Football can be played with
        only 11 players on a team.Players are not allowed to use their hands to move the ball but that can use any
        other part
        of their body.A football game is split into 2 parts first half and second half which are 45 minutes, It can be
        longer if
        someone gets injured during a game or if their is an interferance on a pitch.

    <h2>Why I love Football</h2>
    <q>I learned all about life with a ball at my feet â€“ Ronaldinho</q>
   <!-- Added a desriptive image on for my passion -->
     <img src="https://sites.google.com/site/footballpassionlovelife/_/rsrc/1366100375028/home/1280-love-or-football-puma.jpg" class="photo" alt="Passion">

     <p>Football is a way for me to let out any emotion that is kept inside me wether its anger or anything that
        is bothering me at the time. When I play football I feel free and in my element almost like I have no responsibility
        or sense of worry about things to come. Im just living in the moment enjoying myself and creating stronger bonds with
        people whether it be close friends or aquaintances that I just agreed to play Football with.When playing Football you get
        a glimpse of peoples true self.Because Football can bring certain emotions out of people and often times its a reflection
        of the type of person they are.
